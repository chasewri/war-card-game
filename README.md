# War Card Game
Based on the classic war card game: The cards are divided equally among the players, and the player who flips the card with the highest value wins that particular battle. This version is slightly different, as the player is allowed to wager how many cards they would like to bet when a tie occurs. It allows from increased risk, or more conservative gameplay. The input event only occurs if it is the first tie in a series of tie events. If the player or the enemy has less than the three needed cards for a war, the game is ended. This game recalls its predecessor with its fairly high level of tedium.

## Next Steps
<!-- - The input currently allows any bet input without restraint. -->
<!-- - The CSS cards used are currently formatted for a desktop screen, media queries need to be implemented for use on smaller screens. The CSS framework is made for it, but the cards' classes need to be changed on viewport change. -->
- More game functionality on smaller screens.
- The cards are served locally and need to be prerendered to smoothe gameplay.
- Try to make the UI less gross.
